We fly.

I'm in the air looking at our sky and wondering how this great thing came to be.

I don't really ascribe to a religion of sect but, here, 10km from the surface of the Earth putting my feelings into bits of information that will themselves have their own runaway effects on the universe, I get their appeal. 

What is this universe if not magic?
Why must there be existence?
What even it is to be?

I can feel.

I feel pain, and sorrow, and depression, and loss and emptiness and am surrounded by death and hate.

Yet I feel warmth, and hope and happiness and brightness and joy and am surrounded by peace and love. 

I'm flying, for goodnessâ€™ sake! In the sky!

I, this strange self that I provably cannot define in totality, is looking into itself as it soars through the realm of the gods. As it's internal clock ticks faster than the rest of humanity by just a little bit, it wonders about our hubris. 

Why must time itself bend to us? Why do I yearn to kill death? Why am I beginning to think of the universe as an *engineering problem*? 

I'll come back to these questions after a detour deeper into the first part of my personal hubris. 

My self. 

I think that I *can* know myself. Though I provably *can't*. 

I try regardless. Thinking I can get there in the limit. Thinking I'll see myself as a simple, approaching horizon. Clean clear and defined. But then I look out the window at the foggy horizon. I see the hubris. I turn away. Ignoring the facts and diving deep into myself. Like a fish I exist to swim. But not to swim in the water or even the sky, but to swim in the self.

I see that I am a perception machine. I learn by mapping the universe to my world model. When I'm wrong I investigate the new curious part of the world. I feel some reward when I successfully investigate this space. 

I'm controlled by neurotransmitters evolutionarily optimized for survival and reproduction. Like a puppet on strings. Only some of my time am I me. But if 'I' am not my chemicals, what am I?

A self is not just an abstraction. There is an essence to me.

But when I try to capture it, it flies away, flies like death, but also flies like me, in the sky, among the clouds. 

I see, I think, I do. It seems, at first, like it is the thinking that counts. It seems that I am a box to bring perceptual inputs to behavioral outputs, in which case, the box is the thing to open. 

But for now, we should be careful, let's talk through each one to see if our initial guesses miss anything interesting. 

Let's start with perception. After we pick it apart, we find out that, maybe, perception is everything. Our whole world. All of our understanding is built from this information. One sensory input at a time, our brain is predicting the next token. 

%% Only when one internally created world state (a guess based on sensory information) doesn't align with our previous states, do we see any novel learning. (Or not... what if the constant stream of sensory information is also acting like a kind of training data? But this is besides the point) %%

In order to feel the self, in order to experience, I need to perceive and it needs to be, in some way, new. Can you remember the feeling of consciousness without some new sensory input (or created sensory input in the sense of a visual or auditory internal monologue)?

Why does it seem like you are less a self when you are repeating the mundane (like driving to work every morning)? What if our sense of self is directly tied to novel experiences and the self is variable depending on how surprised you are with some experience (you can create an experience by adjusting your world model to a fuzzy version of the real world of your own design - but this does function different than a world model and more like a sandbox or a dream - we use these fuzzy things to think perhaps...)

What if our entire self is a gathering of perceptions? Those perceptions then allow for learning directly and also are the basis for our thought. 

So then, perhaps, it is our perceptions, or, more aptly, the world model that uses them as a basis which is that center to us to which we call the self...

But we must be careful, for we are not done.

Thoughts. What are they? The black box. The transformation of a world model into a behavior. We can do it by instinct or with reason. What is the difference?

Why do I think deeply on the self, lose focus, gain focus, forget what I was going to say, and come back to try to 'remember' it? How did I know what I would say? I have yet to say it. When I lost focus I stopped thinking on that thing but didn't completely shut down all functions. I may still be driving or typing or drawing or climbing. 

It seems in these moments my conciseness, my self, slinks away to get some time alone, without me, and leaves me as a shell on the beach. Lonely and dead. Only functioning in a lose, automated way. 

When it re-inhabits me perhaps it is a little different or maybe a completely new self finds a home in my shell. I would never know. I know only what the self determines for me. 

This is then my thinking machine. When it leaves I can do 'thinking' of another sort but not the thinking that I am most interested in. The thinking that builds planes and wrestles with the impossibility of understanding itself. 

StepBack()

Looking quickly at the behavioral outputs. Is the self possibly a behavior that the black box sometimes selects? Our sense of self would then not be an emergent property of the architecture of the functional brain itself, but a byproduct of an output of that process. 

In other words, it could be true that the black box is choosing between options like: 'move your arm right', 'move it left', ... and 'be a self'. 

This could look like any other action and just has the emergent property of bringing up the self. Such as referring to its own memories as its own. Or some other action for which the self emerges. Can you be a self without referring to yourself? What if it is the act of referring to yourself that causes you to have a sense of self?

It gets late on this plane, so this conversation will have to be continued when the hour comes to address it again. For now, a farewell:

As I cross the international dateline. This shortest birthday of mine comes to a swift end and I earn more credit time to spend on my flight home. When you read this, it will likely be sometime after this next flight. After I spend my credit. 

So, to you, it wouldn't matter if I should create my personal time to be unchanging from before and after my flights, thus extending my shortest birthday to become my longest one (as I am further from Earth's gravity than I ever was before on my birthday and this height has a greater dilation effect than the contraction effect of the speed of the plane relative to my home). 

So perhaps, to you, it may make more sense for me to have a consistent time and thus your version of my version of my birthday is the longest ever. But my version of my birthday remains the shortest ever (as I assure you I'll be recognizing local time). We already knew that time was a matter of perspective but even when you hold my perspective, time is relative to how we want to use it. 

We want to see a self but maybe it is all relative to something we have yet to define.

Farewell,
