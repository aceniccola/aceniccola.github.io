we think of randomness as noise and something to be filtered out
yet, i dont think this is the right way to imagine it
randomness is the information. it connect to entropy and qm and the observer effect

we should build systems that, like us, focus in the entropy, the beauty in the order of the chaos
what does this mean? when i listen to music what is it that i like? the order? the pattern? the suprises? 
i think i somehow like the combination. this is the same thing i like when scrolling instagram. not the thing i just watched but not something far removed for what i enjoy either

there is a way to build a system we think of as beautiful. chaotic and ordered

a system that recognizes the interesting part of a world

when we build something interesting we build something that differs from anothers obvious map of the world

we must have a common base world model in order to exchange with others
we therefore can build a general intelligence frim a general world model
