What makes startups so exciting and lively? 

Why are we so attracted to the unknown, yet unwilling to venture there alone?

It feels sometimes like I am Sisyphus pushing my boulder up the hill in my battles with myself to put me out there. 
Like the universe wants everyone but me to succeed. 
But I get opportunities too. 

I get to build cells, work on platforms, and start building life in pieces of information. 
I get to live and love and be free. 
But it is hard.
But it is great.
